  <title>Foreign currency exchange rates using Yahoo!</title>
  <description>The exchange-rates plugin will either retrieve foreign currency exchange rates
dynamically from Yahoo! or can store rates in the database on a day-by-day,
currency-by-currency basis retrieving the rate from Yahoo! the first time each
day that a conversion is requested for a given currency. A full set of CRUD
screens is included together with a cache statistics screen (at a URL such as
http://myServer/myApp/exchangeRate/cache) and a test screen for checking that
the system is working (at a URL such as http://myServer/myApp/exchangeRate/test).
The screens assume you are using a layout called main. Your application must
have Internet access for the exchange-rates plugin to function.
